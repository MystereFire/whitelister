# Whitelister Bot
The bot whitelister is a bot I created during the NFT period. It allows you to retrieve wallet addresses easily and export them in several file formats.


## General Commands

- `/whitelist` -> Allows you to send your wallet address.
- `/help` -> Get help on a specific command or list all available commands.
- `/check-wl` -> Get the address you sent.
- `/add-wl *` -> Allows you to add a user to the whitelist.
- `!wiki query` -> Returns the summary of the first search result on Wikipedia.
- `/clear-submitter *` -> Allows you to remove all users from the whitelist.
- `/clear *` => Allows you to remove a user from the white list.
- `/count-wl *` -> Allows to see the number of users in the whitelist.
- `/export *` -> Allows you to export the whitelist in different formats .
- `/setup *` -> Allows to configure the bot( channel, role, network, ... ).
*Admin permissions are required for those commands
